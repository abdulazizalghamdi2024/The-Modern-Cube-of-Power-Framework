This repository presents a validation study of the Modern Power Cube framework for long-term electricity generation forecasting using Transformer-based deep learning models. The study leverages 25 years of annual electricity generation data from the Saudi Electricity Company to evaluate forecasting performance, benchmarked against classical and machine learning baselines. All source code, evaluation metrics, and reproducible workflows are included, with the official archived release published on Zenodo under the Apache 2.0 license.
